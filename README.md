# rsm4dcm

`rsm4dcm` is a Python library for recursively searching DICOM files inside a folder with subdirectories and then moving them into another folder.

Most of the public medical images can be downloaded from the [NBIA Data Retriever tool](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/Downloading+Images+Using+the+NBIA+Data+Retriever)
provided by the [TCIA](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/). As explained on their website, [DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/using/overview) is the primary file format used for radiology imaging. Any downloaded file will come as ***XXXX.dcm***.

Once downloaded, these medical images are placed into a **directory containing many different subdirectories** as described by the first picture.

Whether you are a health professional or a developer, you might need to reorganize these files into **a simple folder** where each and every file is directly accessible.
